Project Description - Mailbox Monitor
=====================================
The Mailbox Monitor detects the presence of "snail mail" within an old-fashioned mailbox.

The presence of objects placed between an IR emitter and detector is detected by a program running on an Arduino development board (MailboxMonitor).  The detection process is triggered by a requests received through the Serial device.  The result of the detection process is reported through the Serial device. 

A Processing program (MailboxReporter) sends detection requests to the Arduino at a specified interval and receives the reported data.  Based on the response from the Arduino, a visual notification is displayed to indicate that mail is or is not present.  An email notification can optionally be sent when mail is added to or removed from the mail box.

Designed to be placed in a mailbox to detect that mail is present and needs to be retrieved.  An RF modem, such as an XBee, is intended to be used for wireless communication between the device placed in a mailbox and a computer.


Software Installation
=====================
The Mailbox Monitor project consists of a project for the Arduino IDE (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and a project for the Processing IDE (http://www.processing.org/download/).  Each project can be compiled, installed, and run with its associated IDE. 


Hardware Setup
==============
The necessary parts are:
  1. RF modem, such as XBee or BlueSMiRF
  2. One IR emitter LED
  3. One IR detector (phototransistor or photodiode)

For the IR emitter and detector, I use a RadioShack part no. 276-0142.  For the RF modem I use the series 1 XBee.
