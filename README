My Arduino Project Repository
=============================
A collection of projects created for the Arduino microcontroller development platform (http://www.arduino.cc), including schematics and source code for the Arduino IDE.  Most projects are accompanied by a program written with the Processing language for interfacing between the Arduino and a regular computer.  Contains the following projects:


* Ringtone Jukebox - Created February 2011
------------------------------------------
Play RTTTL formatted ringtones.  Contains 16 preprogrammed ringtones, with capacity for storing a custom ringtone.  A Processing based ringtone visualizer draws colors, determined by note characteristics received through the serial device, as the ringtone is played.


* 3D Map Control - Created April 2011
-------------------------------------
Use the Wii Nunchuk to control Google Earth in a web browser.  Nunchuk state information transmitted from an Arduino to a computer is made available through a simple web service, provided by a simple Processing/Java based web server.  JavaScript code to control the Google Earth web browser plug-in is included.


* Mailbox Monitor - Created April 2011
--------------------------------------
Detect the presence of "snail mail" within an old-fashioned mailbox.  The presence of objects placed between an IR emitter and detector is detected by a program running on an Arduino board and reported to a computer responsible for posting a notification.  Communication between Arudino board and computer is performed through an RF modem, such as an XBee.

* Easy Program Launcher - Created June 2011
-------------------------------------------
Use the Teensy USB to emulate a keyboard and send key commands to a personal computer that cause an application to be launched.  Designed to be embedded within an Easy Button from Staples, the key commands are sent when the Easy Button is pressed.  The Easy Program Launcher is compatible with both the Windows and Linux operating systems, using a switch hidden in the Easy Button's battery compartment to select the desired operating system.  Based on the Awesome Button by Matt Richardson.
