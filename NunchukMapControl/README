Project Description - Arduino Nunchuk Map Control version 1.0
=============================================================
Use the Wii Nunchuk to control Google Earth in the Web Browser with the Arduino Nunchuk Map Control.

The Arduino Nunchuk Map Control is a project for the Arduino Development Environment that uses the Arduino development board to read, decode, and transmit data received from the Wii Nunchuk to a PC.  A simple Processing/Java application running on the PC reads the Wii Nunchuk data from the Arduino development board and makes it available to any modern web browser through a simple web service.

The goal of the project is to use the Wii Nunchuk to control mapping applications such as Google Earth and Google Maps in the web browser.  JavaScript code to control the Google Earth web browser plug-in with the Wii Nunchuk is included with the project.


Software Installation
=====================
The Nunchuk Map Control project consists of a project for the Arduino IDE (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and a project for the Processing IDE (http://www.processing.org/download/).  Each project can be compiled, installed, and run with its associated IDE.  

The Arduino IDE project, NunchukInterface, is fairly simple and should require no special configuration.

The Processing IDE project, NunchukServer, contains a web server component to make the Wii Nunchuk data available to a web browser.  The web server also serves the Google Earth application pages.  Some settings for the web server may need to be adjusted for it to function properly in your environment.

If the Nunchuk Map Control project was not installed in the default Arduino project location, the variable specifying the document root for the web server, the folder that contains the files for the web server to serve, will need to be changed.  The default value for the web server's document root is the current user's home directory plus "/Documents/Arduino/NunchukMapControl/MapPages":
  webRoot = System.getProperty("user.home") + "/Documents/Arduino/NunchukMapControl/MapPages";

This assumes that the Nunchuk Map Control project is installed in the default "My Documents" directory on your system, and that the web pages to be served are contained within a subdirectory named "MapPages".  For Windows the value would be something like:
  C:/Users/me/Documents/Arduino/NunchukMapControl/MapPages

If the NunchukMapControl project is not installed in this directory, or a different set of web pages is to be served, the 'webRoot' variable must be set to the location of these web pages.  

The default port used by the web server is port 8049.  To use a different port, set the SERVER_PORT variable to the desired port number.

The default serial port used to read data from the Arduino is specified as the first available serial port.  If your Arduino is using a serial port other than the first available serial port, you will need specify that serial port when the Serial device is opened in the setup() function.  


Hardware Setup
==============
Make the following pin connections between the Wii Nunchuk and the Arduino board:
  - Nunchuk data line to analog pin 4
  - Nunchuk clock line to analog pin 5

Nunchuk pin diagram:

                 NC
             __  |  __
            |  \___/  |
  Clock ->  | *  *  * |  <- GND
   3.3V ->  |_*__*__*_|  <- Data
                 |
                 NC

I connect the Wii Nunchuk's 3.3V and GND pins to the matching pins on the Arduino board, but these can be connected to any 3.3V power source.


Usage
=====
With the NunchukInterface program running on the Arduino board and the NunchukServer program running on the PC and receiving data from the Arduino board, start a web browser and specify the a URL like the following to run the Google Earth example:
  http://localhost:8049/earth.html
  
If you have changed the server port or file locations, you will need to adjust the URL to match those changes.
